h1. Epoch - Date conversion leveraging Chronic

Quite often I find I need to convert to an from epoch and sadly don't have Ruby / IRB installed.  This simple Rails 2 app leverages the awesome "chronic":https://github.com/mojombo/chronic/ gem to do the heavy lifting.

Hope it proves useful to someone out there :)
